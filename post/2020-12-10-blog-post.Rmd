John Mulaney once said "College was like a four-year game show called 'Do my friends hate me or do I just need to go to sleep?'"" I now understand why he said this. 

## More wise words using R and Python 

 
```{r}
library(reticulate)
JohnMulaney<-"We started chanting McDonalds McDonalds!"
```


```{python}
OnceSaid="And my dad pulled into the drive thru, and we started cheering and then he ordered one black coffee for himself and kept driving"
print(r.JohnMulaney,OnceSaid)
```
