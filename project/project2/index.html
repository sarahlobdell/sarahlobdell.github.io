<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><em>The dataset I chose is called &quot;Affairs.&quot; This dataset has information based on infidelity data collected from a survey carried out by Psychology Today in 1969. The data has 601 observations on 9 variables. The 9 variables include affairs, gender, age, years married, children, religiousness, education, occupation, and rating. Affairs is numeric in which an entry of 0 means there were no extramarital affairs, whereas any number greater has had at least 1 affair. Gender states whether the entry is a male or female. Age is the median age range in which that person falls; for example 17.5 is defined as someone under 20, while 22 codes for the range 20-24, 27 for 25-29, and so on. Years married measures the years the person has been married ranging from 3 months or less to 12 or more years. Children is a yes or no answer that states if the person has children. Religiousness measures how religious the person interviewed is, and education measures the amount of education that person has. Occupation measures whether the person has an occupation and to what extent, i.e, no occupation to professional level on the Hollingshead classification with reverse numbering. Lastly, rating measures the degree of happiness that person feels in the marriage, with 1 being very unhappy to 5 being very happy.</em> <em>In order to read the data, install.packages(&quot;AER&quot;) was first downloaded.</em></p>

<p><em>The follow-up one-way ANOVAs for each variable ran had two significant p values, both of 2.2e-16, for education and occupation. Both p values are significant for education and occupation meaning one gender differs. The univariate ANOVA showed a difference in means for education with females having a mean of 15.2571 (the range between some college and college graduate) and males having a mean of 17.1678 (the range between some graduate work and a masters degree). For the difference in means of occupation, women had a mean of 3.38413, and males had a mean of 5.08741 according to the Hollingshead classification. However, this is reverse numbering meaning women having a lower mean actually means their occupation is ranked higher/pays a higher salary, i.e, administrative personnel category vs skilled manual category for men.</em></p>

<h4>MANOVA Write-Up</h4>
<p><em>A one-way MANOVA was conducteed to determine the effect of gender on affairs, years married, religiousness, education, occupation, and rating. Examination of bivariate density plots for each group revealed no stark deparures from multivariate normality. Examination of covariance matrices for each group revealed relative homogeneity. No univariate or multivariate outliers were evident and MANOVA was considered to be an appropriate analysis technique.</em></p>

<p><em>Univariate ANOVAs for each dependent variable were conducted as follow-up tests to the MANOVA, using the Bonferroni method for controlling Type I error rates for multiple comparisons. The univariate ANOVAs for education and occupation were significant, F (1, 599) = 112.41, p &lt; 2.2e-16, and F (1, 599) = 167.92, p &lt; 2.2e-16, respectively. </em></p>
